# /panda/themes

In PandaCSS, a theme can handle both light and dark modes.

If you want to use another light & dark colorset, you must add another theme.
- Go to `panda/tokens/colors` and create another colorset variable.
- Go to `./index.ts`, copy defaultTheme variable and replace the color with the new colorset.
- Refer PandaCSS doc: [Multiple Themes](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/multiple-themes)
